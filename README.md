TECO - Text Editor and COrrector, an old classic, reimplmented in Pascal

This program dates back to 1989, most of the work was done by 1991. I've hacked it enough to get it to work today in 2021.

This is fairly standard Pascal, but it was optimized to work back in the days of MS-DOS so it's a bit quirky.
