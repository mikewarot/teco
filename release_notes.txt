  "Back when I was 25, we didn't have any fancy windows and mice...
  AND WE LIKED IT THAT WAY!", yeah, SSSSSUUUURRRRREEEEE....

  Rev
   4 - Add command input routine, begin implementing a simple
       command interpreter
   5 - Implement string parameters
   6 - Implement number parameters and a small (10) stack
   7 - Implement a simple form of numeric expressions
   8 - Procedure Execute added, to allow commands to come from multiple
       sources, and allow the "current" buffer to be one of many.
       Add LineOriented()
   9 - Move TBuffer and Tstack out to separate units
       Add ExecStr()
  10 - More debugging....
  11 - File oriented I/O, buffers, etc.
  12 - Remove ExecStr()
       Make all q-registers general purpose.... (You're right, Ken)
       procedures use pointers instead of VAR parameters
  13 - Add search and replace. (Pattern matching supported, but slow).

 1/21/91 - MAW
  14 - Write first draft of TECO.DOC, revise code to more closely match
       definitions in DEC's manual.

 1/21/91 - MAW - Big problem, because of the interpretive nature of the
               current implementation, conditional branching looks to be
               a real problem. Considering "compiling" commands, which
               would eliminate most semantic ambiguities, in addition
               to increasing the speed of operations.


 Varsion 100 - experimental, compiling version. (NOT COMPILING!)

  Notes: Flag "C" and 1 is the Case Sensitive flag, default off (0)
         Flag "T" and 8 is the NO ECHO flags, default off (echo keys)

 7/17/91 - Replace all tbuffer references with tbuf, to allow for file I/O.
           A simple search/replace command actually works now!
           First release to the public

 7/22/91 - Correct bug in GetConstant which pushed junk on the stack
         - Correct logic fault, never allow GetStringParam to be inside
           a conditional if an argument is REQUIRED, if the procedure isn't
           called, the argument becomes part of the command, not just
           another parameter!   Append is the one exception to this rule.
 7/23/91 - Fix bug in Search, wouldn't find a match at the current cursor
           position.

 7/25/91 - Fix bug (feature?) which caused EX in a .INI file to be ignored
         - Add StringSearch, a MUCH faster engine for searching through
           the buffer. Supports most of the "String Build" characters

1.03รก--- release?

12/03/91 - Modify code to use Release(QStack.Pop,Done) to eliminate bug
           which eats memory. Old version didn't properly page text...

           Modify ExitLoop to pass F> in a command

01/03/2021 - Modify code to work in Windows 10, 64 Bit,
  on a machine with with more Disk and RAM than MS-DOS could even access.

1.08 alpha - July 2024
  Start to refactor code, make names less ambigious, set up for 64 bit operation
