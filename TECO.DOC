 *********************** A Note from the author *************************

I first learned TECO on a PDP-11/70 while at attending college at
Rose-Hulman in Terre Haute, Indiana. A bit of nostalgia lead my to
create a version for my own use, primarily as a batch editor.

This is by no means a complete implementation of TECO, which is why it
is called TECO/2: Half a TECO! It does do the basic functions such as
paged file handling, search and replace, Qregisters, and the stack.
It does NOT do all of the string matching or condition expression execution,
thus it may be limiting to all of the real hackers out there.


This command syntax this version supports is derived from the document:

  Found in a "trash heap"!                  Found long ago with some
  @FermiLab                                 11/70 Assembler Source Code

This is only a hobby project for me, I do however, welcome all suggestions
and feedback (especially bug reports).

Please send a postcard if you actually decide to use this program, to let
me know I helped someone.

              a lot in writing this.

 *********************** Implementation Details *************************

Language: Free Pascal 3.2 source code is available at https://github.com/mikewarot/teco

TECO is a character oriented, command line interface, text editor. Commands
are entered at the "* " prompt, backspace deletes the previous character,
and the escape key (echoed as $) delineates commands, a double escape
is interpreted as the end of the command line, which then causes the command
to be executed.

At startup the file TECO.INI is loaded into the . Qregister (the command
buffer) and executed. The command line is loaded into the A Qregister.

If TECO.EXE is renamed, the INI file read will take the same name as the .EXE

If the Z Qregister is not empty, it is executed before command input is taken,
as a "prompt" macro.

Qregs:
  There are 37 Q registers, 0-9,A-Z, and ".", the command buffer.

Flags:
  UC & 1     - If set, searches become case sensitive
  UC defaults to 0

  UT & 8     - If set, ^T does not echo keyboard input
  UT defaults to 0

Execute():
  This routine takes 2 parameters, both Q-registers. The first is a
buffer containing the macro to execute, the second is the default buffer
on which the macro will operate. This is where the real work of the TECO/2
interpreter takes place.

Immediate Commands:
  <CR>       - Insert CR/LF pair into command
  <BS>       - Delete last character of command buffer
  <ESC><ESC> - Terminate command entry, execute command
               Note: To enter <ESC><ESC> into the command buffer,
                     type <ESC><Space><BS><ESC>

  All other characters are appended to the command buffer.

Numeric quantities:

  B  - beginning position of buffer, always zero.
  Z  - end position of buffer, also count of characters in buffer
  .  - Current position in the buffer
  H  - wHole buffer, equivalent to B,Z
  
  Note that math operators below are INFIX,  i.e.   7+2=~$$  will print 9

  +  - Addition
  -  - Subtraction
  *  - Multiplication
  /  - Integer division (divide by zero trapped)
  &  - Bitwise AND
  #  - Bitwise OR

Command list:
  CR,LF,
  <Space>
  <Comma>     - "NOP" commands, ignored during execution

  =           - Pop number from stack, display in decimal,
                followed by a CR/LF pair

  [n]C        - Move n (1) characters forward in text buffer

  [n]R        - Move n (1) characters backward in text buffer

  nJ          - Jump to position n in buffer, note n is Required.

  [n]L        - Move n (1) lines forward or backward,
                0L moves to the start of the current line.

  [n|range]T  - type n(1) lines of text, or type range of text.

  [n|range]V  - view n(1) lines of text before and after the cursor,
                or show range of text

  [:]Itext    - Insert (append) text into current buffer

  [:]nI       - Insert (append) ascii code (n) into current buffer

  [n]D        - Delete n (1) characters forward or backward

  [n|range]K  - delete n (1) lines of text, or delete range of text.

  A           - Append buffer from input file, stupid algorithm

  P           - Put buffer to output file

  Y           - Put the current page, yank in a new one


  [n]Stext    - Search n (1) times for text, backward in n < 0.
                If successful, the pointer is after the matched text,
                otherwise the cursor is placed at 0.
                The length of the matched string is left on the stack,
                for use with the FR command below...

  Ntest       - Search 1 time, in the forward direction for test, the
                following String Match characers are supported:
                  ^Q - Interpret the next character literally
                  ^X - Any character
                  ^N - Negate the next character
                  ^E extended
                    A - Alpha characters
                    B - Blanks (non-alpha, non-numberic)
                    D - digits (0-9)
                    R - alphanumeRic
                    [ - any of the following characters until ]
                Case is only significant if the "Case Sensitive" flag is
                turned ON. { EC bit 1 }
                The length of the matched string is left on the stack,
                for use with the FR command below...

  nFRtext     - If n (result from a search) is > 0 then delete
                'n' characters, replacing it with text.

                  i.e.  Sfoo$FRbar$  ==> search for "foo" and replace
                                         with "bar"
                                         does nothing if foo is not found
                note: returns the number of characters that WOULD have
                      been inserted if the preceding search has failed


  E - Extended Commands
    EBfilename- Assign the filename for Both reading and writing,
                read a page into the buffer

    EC        - Flush buffers, Close the current files,
                leaving the buffer empty

    ERfilename- Assign the filename for Reading,
                read a page into the buffer

    EQqfilename-Assigns filename for reading, into Qregister q.

    ET        - Dump the current text buffer, for debugging TECO/2

    EWfilename- Assign the filename for Writing

    EX        - Exit TECO/2

    Eq        - push flag q

    nEq       - pop value into flag q

  [:]^Uqtext  - insert (append) text into q-register

  [:]n^Uq     - insert (append) character n into q-register

  nUq         - Store n into numeric Q-register q.

  Gq          - Insert the contents of Q-register q

  :Gq         - Show the contents of Q-register q

  Qq          - Push the contents of numeric Q-reqister q

  nQq         - Push the ascii code for the text in Q-register q,
                at position n. If n is out of bounds, a -1 is returned.

  :Qq         - Push the number of characters in Q-register q.
  
  nUq         - Set the numeric value of Q register q to n

  [:][n|range]Xq
              - Like Type, but results replace contents of q-register
                instead of going to screen. If colon modified, q-register
                is not cleared, but rather is appended.

  Mq          - Execute the contents of text in Q-register as a command.
                M commands may be recursively invoked.
                Arguments are passed through this command to commands in the
                Q-register. Likewise, values can be returned.

  ^Atext^A    - Type text on display

  ^T          - Pause and get a key from the keyboard, pushing ascii value.
                If ET&8 has not been set, the key is echoed.

  n^T         - Type ascii n on display

  !text!      - A label for conditional branching, etc. - text is ignored
                Also used to comment text in a macro.


LOOP/BRANCHING COMMANDS

  n<commands> - Execute commands n times, if n <= 0 the interpreter
                skips ahead to just past the next >
                (n defaults to 32767!, so be careful, it could take
                 quite a long time to execute if your not careful!)

  n;          - Exits a loop if n >= 0   (n defaults to -1 (no skip))
  n:;         - Exits a loop if n <  0   (n defaults to -1 (skip))

                Example:  1000<N.ZIP$FR.PAK$;>
                Would do up to 1000 search/replaces, quiting as soon
                as the last one is done...


  F>          - Branch to the end of the current iteration
                (before the ">") or to the end of the current command
                string if not in an iteration.

  F|          - Branch to the next | OR '
  F'          - Branch to the next '

  n"Xcom'     - Conditional expression, com, will be executed
                only if n meets criterion X.

  n"Xcm1|cm2' - Conditional expression, cm1, will be executed
                only if n meets criterion X.
                Conditional expression, cm2, will be executed
                only if n fails criterion X.

  Conditional's criterions are:
    A    ASCII Alphabetical (upper or lower case)
    C    RADIX 50.
    D    ASCII digit
    E    zero
    F    false or failed (zero)
    G    Greater than zero
    L    Less than zero
    N    Not equal to zero
    R    ASCII Alphanumeric
    S    Successful (less than zero)
    T    True (less than zero)
    U    Unsuccessful (equal to zero)

  Note:  n defaults to 0


  All other commands are treated as an error, and displayed as such.

 ************************** Revision History ****************************
  7/18/91 - Add code to do a rudimentary loop of the form   n< code here >
  7/22/91 - Fix bug in function GetConstant that pushed extra junk on the stack
          - Fix bug which caused an unsucessful search/replace to execute the
            replace argument as a command. (Nasty litte critter, that one)

1.02á
  7/23/91 - Add code to entirely skip a loop if the count <= 0
            Add code to return a number on a bad search
            Add support for the ; command, to make search/replace work
  7/25/91 - Modify Search to put pointer AFTER match, to match specs
            Design new search routine, much faster! Supports most of the
            string building characters from the documentation.


1.05á

 12/03/91 - Found some big bugs last week working with a large file (78k)

  Changes since 1.03á :

  Bugs fixed:

    Page command didn't work properly

    EX didn't write all of file out correctly, dropped contents of buffer!

    Memory allocation errors cause heap to overflow after a while

    No U command to store EC flag

  Features added:

    U command to store to a numeric qregister

    F> to skip to the end of a loop

    N command supports some pattern matching operations, and is MUCH
      faster than Search, but can only handle 31 character strings, and
      doesn't do paging as in real teco.
      (NOT COMPATIBLE with REAL TECO!)
      N will be merged with code for S command when it is all tested
      (Around version 1.10)

    Add conditional Expressions :

      "G  do if greater than zero
      "E  do if equal to zero


Version 1.06á - 12/04/91 - MAW
  
  Revise error handling routines, put in BUFF.PAS
  Fix bug in TBuf.Done, wouldn't output memory unless there was input.
  
Version 1.07 Alpha - 01/03/2021 - MAW

  Hack code enough to get it working in Windows 10, 64 Bit, under Free Pascal 3.2

Version 1.08 Alpha - 07/19/2024 - MAW
 
  Fix a bug - nUq  didn't store n in the numeric Q register q-register
  Noticed when watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvxZ7wfKj8E and I couldn't follow along
