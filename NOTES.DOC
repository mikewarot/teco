  Arguments for compilation of commands prior to execution:

   Catch syntax errors before a command is executed.
     Eliminate "go half way through and bomb" type problems.

    Improved speed of execution
      Pre-compiled macros... 'nuff said

    Allow really tricky conditional branches in code to work properly.


Random ideas:
  Turbo IDE like environment, F8 traces over, F7 traces into,
  F4 runs to a breakpoint, examine Q registers, etc.

  Multiple windows, command window, etc.

  Compiled code has pointers to source

  Code can't modify itself directly (important!)

  When a buffer is modified, it's "compiled" flags goes away.
